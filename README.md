📚 Assignment Questions
1️⃣ Black-Box vs. White-Box Testing 🎭
🧐 What is black-box testing, and how does it differ from white-box testing?
💡 Provide real-world examples where each type is most effective.

2️⃣ Equivalence Partitioning ✂️
🤔 Explain the concept of equivalence partitioning and how it helps in reducing test cases.
📌 Can you think of a practical example where this method would be useful?

3️⃣ Boundary Value Analysis 📏
🔍 What is boundary value analysis, and why is it useful in software testing?
